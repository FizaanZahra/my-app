### Project Description
The Faculty Performance Monitoring System is a web-based platform designed to collect and analyze faculty performance feedback from students in their respective colleges. The system ensures weekly updates on faculty performance and allows only approved users (administrators, faculty, and authorized personnel) to log in and access¬†insights.

### The Problem statement
In many educational institutions, students face difficulties in providing honest feedback about their teachers due to:
‚úÖ Fear of retaliation ‚Äì Students may hesitate to express negative feedback.
‚úÖ Lack of structured feedback collection ‚Äì No formalized way to gather opinions.
‚úÖ No performance insights for faculty ‚Äì Teachers lack data-driven suggestions for improvement.


### The Solution
‚ø° Secure Feedback Submission
	‚Ä¢	Students can select a faculty member and rate their teaching.
‚úÖ Encourages honest feedback without fear.

‚ø¢ College & Faculty Selection
	‚Ä¢	Institutions can register and manage faculty members.
	‚Ä¢	Students can choose their college and faculty before submitting feedback.
‚úÖ Allows customization for different colleges.

‚ø£ Performance Analytics & Insights
	‚Ä¢	Admins can view aggregated feedback and track trends over time.
	‚Ä¢	Faculty members can receive constructive feedback to improve.
‚úÖ Supports faculty development through data-driven insights.

‚ø§ Clean & Intuitive UI
	‚Ä¢	Uses React & Material UI for a modern and user-friendly design.
‚úÖ Ensures easy navigation for students and administrators.
